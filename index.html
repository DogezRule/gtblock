<h2>Description of Prototype:</h2>
<p>The Sahara Desert is extremely hot and dry with little life other than a few small animals and plants. There is verry little rain in the Sahara, only raining once every 200 days (about 6 and a half months) or so, the Sahara gets 3 inches of rain per year. There is verry little vegetation in the Sahara due to the tiny amounts of water, some of which are small patches of tall grass, a few palm trees (only around an oasis), and cacti. The Sahara Desert is in north central Africa, covering 11 countries and is the size of China.</p>
